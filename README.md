# [HTML in XLSX to DOC](https://github.com/nl10n/easyloc/blob/master/html_to_doc_public.py)

HTML text is stored within cells of an MS Excel workbook. This script extracts the HTML and saves it to a .doc file with a filename created from text on the same row as the HTML. The .doc file will retain all the formatting of the HTML. This code is useful for generating documents for in-context review.
